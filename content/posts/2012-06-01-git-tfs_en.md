### 1. Clone main branch of the TFS repository

-   With the entire historic of the repository (long but advised…)  
    `git tfs clone http://myTfsServer:8080/tfs/TfsRepository $/MyProject/TruncName .`

<!-- -->

-   From only the last commit of the repository  
    `git tfs quick-clone http://myTfsServer:8080/tfs/TfsRepository $/MyProject/TruncName .`

At the Visual Studio first opening, choose to deconnect temporary the
solution from the server (otherwise it will modify some files)

### 2. Synchronise with the Tfs repository

#### 2.1. Fetch the commits from the trunc

`git tfs fetch`

#### 2.2. Commit to the Tfs repository

##### 2.2.1 Commit manualy `git tfs ct`

! Always do a fetch & rebase (or a merge) before the commit (to avoid a
overwrite of a file by your modifications)

##### 2.2.2 Commit automaticly some local Git commits `git tfs rcheckin`

Note : During the use of rcheckin, you can add references, in your local
commit message, to Tfs workitems to associate or close them ( during the
commits on the TFS Server).  
The synthaxe is the following :  
`git-tfs-work-item: <id> associate`  
`git-tfs-work-item: <id> resolve`

### 3. Manage a Tfs branch

#### 3.1. Fetch the Tfs branch

Since the version 0.16 of git-tfs where my work was merged, you could
easily fetch a TFS branch with the command :

`git tfs init-branch $/MyProject/BrancheName`

#### 3.2. Fetch new commits from the Tfs branch

`git tfs fetch -i myTfsBranch`

#### 3.3. Commit on the Tfs branch

`git tfs ct -i myTfsBranch`

#### 4. Sources

The goal of ‘git build’ script is to run a command which determine if a
commit is good before pushing your commits on the remote.  
It could easily configured to build your project and run the unit tests
automaticaly in a private build and then assure you that your git
history contains only good commits.

Principle
---------

The different steps of the script are the following :

1\. Clone the current git repository in a temporary folder  
2. Rebase on upstream modifications  
3. Run a custom command (build, unit tests,…)  
4. Push commits only if the custom command succeed  
5. Give a feedback of the build by a notification

Installation
------------

1\. Copy the
[git-build](https://raw.github.com/pmiossec/git-build/master/git-build)
script in a directory that is in your path (or add the directory to your
path) keeping the file name ‘git-build’.  
2. Copy the 2 files
![git-build\_success.png](https://raw.github.com/pmiossec/git-build/master/git-build_success.png "git-build_success.png")
and
![git-build\_fail.png](https://raw.github.com/pmiossec/git-build/master/git-build_fail.png "git-build_fail.png")
in the same directory keeping the names “git-build\_success.png” and
“git-build\_fail.png”.  
3. If you are under windows, install
[Growl](http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/) and add growl folder to the
path.

Configuration
-------------

For each new git repository you use and only one time, set the command
that will be run before pushing.

Example using maven :

    git config private-build.command "mvn clean install"

Example using msbuild :

    git config private-build.command "msbuild my.build /t:UnitTests /p:Configuration:Debug"

Use
---

Each time you want to push, instead, call the command :

    git build

Advantages
----------

The advantages of such a solution are :

-   A really easy way to replace Countinuous Integration for projects in
    early stage or for small teams,
-   A better reppository history because no bad commits ( or no history
    rework of already pushed commits)
-   Easy build and test on all the branches, not only the master branch
-   Could replace a Countinuous Integration and don’t have maintenance
    costs for the CI anymore.

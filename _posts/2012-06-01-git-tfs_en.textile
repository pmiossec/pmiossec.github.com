_(or how to use Git in unfriendly environment!)_

h3. 1. Clone main branch of the TFS repository

* With the entire historic of the repository (long but advised...)
@git tfs clone http://myTfsServer:8080/tfs/TfsRepository $/MyProject/TruncName .@

* From only the last commit of the repository
@git tfs quick-clone http://myTfsServer:8080/tfs/TfsRepository $/MyProject/TruncName .@

At the Visual Studio first opening, choose to deconnect temporary the solution from the server (otherwise it will modify some files)

h3. 2. Synchronise with the Tfs repository

h4. 2.1. Fetch the commits from the trunc

@git tfs fetch@

h4. 2.2. Commit to the Tfs repository

h5. 2.2.1 Commit manualy
@git tfs ct@

! Always do a fetch & rebase (or a merge) before the commit (to avoid a overwrite of a file by your modifications)

h5. 2.2.2 Commit automaticly some local Git commits
@git tfs rcheckin@

Note : During the use of rcheckin, you can add references, in your local commit message, to Tfs workitems to associate or close them ( during the commits on the TFS Server).
The synthaxe is the following :
@git-tfs-work-item: <id> associate@ 
@git-tfs-work-item: <id> resolve@

h3. 3. Manage a Tfs branch

h4. 3.1. Fetch the Tfs branch

Since the version 0.16 of git-tfs where my work was merged, you could easily fetch a TFS branch with the command :

@git tfs init-branch $/MyProject/BrancheName@

h4. 3.2. Fetch new commits from the Tfs branch

@git tfs fetch -i myTfsBranch@

h4. 3.3. Commit on the Tfs branch

@git tfs ct -i myTfsBranch@

h4. 4. Sources

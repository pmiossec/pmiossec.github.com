_(or the unbreakable build!_

In a previous post, we saw the 'git build' script to push commits only when the commits satisfy some conditions ( after the run of a custom command).

If you use git-tfs to checkin in a TFS repository, the original script is not useable :(

But you could find "here":https://raw.github.com/pmiossec/git-build/4gittfs/git-build a version of the 'git build' script working with git-tfs.

For other informations, see the original post...

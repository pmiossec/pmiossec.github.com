This is a paragraph, which is text surrounded by whitespace. Paragraphs can be on one 
line (or many), and can drone on for hours.  "Quotes" and 'quotes' are handled 
nicely--as are dashes and such.

Now some inline markup like _italics_,  *bold*, and <code>code()</code>. Note
that underscores in words are ignored. Textile also has a few handy character helpers like 
trademark(TM), reserved(R), copyright(C), ellipses ..., superscripts^2, subscripts~2, 
and so on.

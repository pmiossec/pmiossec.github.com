This is a paragraph, which is text surrounded by whitespace. Paragraphs can be on one 
line (or many), and can drone on for hours.  "Quotes" and 'quotes' are handled 
nicely--as are dashes and such.

Here is a link to "Warped":http://warpedvisions.org.

Now some inline markup like _italics_,  *bold*, and <code>code()</code>. Note
that underscores in words are ignored. Textile also has a few handy character helpers like 
trademark(TM), reserved(R), copyright(C), ellipses ..., superscripts^2, subscripts~2, 
and so on.

  which(is_easy, enough) to_remember();
</pre>

Text with  
newlines

=======================================


Overview
Textile works by allowing you to type in plain text, and have that text be converted to XHTML in a way you would expect. You can enter your own HTML tags if you wish, and these will not be affected by the Textile processing system.

For instance, instead of inserting <p> tags around your paragraphs, just hit the enter key twice. Textile will enclose the blocks of text that look like paragraphs in the proper tags.
